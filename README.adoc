= Coroutines Sandbox with TornadoFx

*Features*

* Kotlin Coroutines
* TornadoFx (see link:https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-guide[TornadoFx Guide])
* How coroutines can make your code non-blocking

== Usage

* Build `./gradlew build`

If you are on Java11 you need to add the link:https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-guide/blob/master/part1/2.%20Setting%20Up.md[OpenJfx dependencies]
because JavaFx was removed from the JDK. The following additional gradle dependencies might do the trick:

`implementation("org.openjfx:javafx:11.0.2")`
`implementation("org.openjfx:javafx-base:11.0.2")`
`implementation("org.openjfx:javafx-controls:11.0.2")`
